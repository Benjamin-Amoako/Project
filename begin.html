        <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of HyperText and Markup language. HyperText defines the link between the web pages. A markup language is used to define the tet document withi tag which defines the structure of web pages. HTML is a markup language that is used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content to display it in the required format.</p>
        Before learning the intricacies of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript, it is important that you gain a solid understanding of the technologies that help transform these plaintext files to the rich multimedia displays you see on your computer orhandheld device when browsing the World Wide Web. For example, a filecontaining markup and client-side code HTML and CSS is useless without a web browser to view it, and no one besides yourself will see your content unless a web server is involved. Web servers make your content available to others who, in turn, use their web browsers to navigate to an address and wait for the server to send information to them. You will be intimately involved in this publishing process because you must create files and then put them on a server to make them available in the first place, and you must ensure that your content will appear to the end user as you intended.
        <h2>A Brief History of HTML and the World Wide Web</h2>
        Once upon a time, back when there weren't any footprints on the moon,
        some farsighted folks decided to see whether they could connect several
        major computer networks together. I'll spare you the names and stories
        (there are plenty of both), but the eventual result was the “mother of allnetworks,” which we call the Internet.
        Until 1990, accessing information through the Internet was a rather technical affair. It was so hard,  in fact, that even Ph.D.-holding physicists were
        often frustrated when trying to swap data. One such physicist, the nowfamous (and knighted) Sir Tim    Berners-Lee, cooked up a way to easily cross-reference text on the Internet through hypertext links.

        <h1>KNOWING A LITTLE ABOUT CREATING WEBSITE</h1>
        HTML is made up of series of hierarchical elements. Most elements have an opening tag and a closing tag, with some content sandwiched in between. If you are used to marking up chapters, headings and subheadings, this concept should be easy to grasp.
        <p>HTML do not walk alone.
            <br>Nearly every website in the world is built using 3 core programing languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In this article, we will "dissect" the anatomy of websites to give you and understanding of what these fundamental languages are and how they work together to form something that is both visually impressive and functional.
        </p>
        <h2>HTML:<span>THE SKELETON</span></h2>
        HyperText Markup Language(HTML) is the language of the web, without HTML you wouldn't have a website. <br> HTML defines the content and structure of you website. Using a body for and analogy, HTML would be your skeleton, holding everything together and providing a base to hang everything off. A HTML file is made up of numerous HTML elements.<br>
        I will provide a pdf for you which will help you in the basis of learning html.

        <h2>CSS:<span>THE SKIN</span></h2>If HTML is the skeleton to our body, then Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) is the skin. CSS is used to change the look and feel of websites. It is where you define you colour achemes, fonts, spacing, layouts and more.
            <p>CSS is written in separate file to the HTML. This is to allow separation of concerns and make our lives easier when it comes to testing and maintenance. This also makes our styles more reusable, if we put styles directly into the HTML then we wouldn't be able to use the styles across different HTML pages.</p>
            <p>90% of CSS is fairly straightforward, select the HTML element you want to stlye, specify what attribute you want to change and the value you want to change it to. Tinse and repeat this pattern and you can get very far. CSS becomes more complicated whan you want to complex layouts, animations or CSS functions.</p>

        <h2>JAVASCRIPT:<span>THE MUSCLES</span></h2>
        JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich to add behaviour to websites. Up to this point the web was relatively static place, good for looking up in information but not very interactive. In our body analogy, JavaScript takes the place of muscles, providing motion and behaviour to our limbs.
        <p>There are alot of Programming languages out there, but if you want to do web development, then JavaScript is the dominant force. Even other languages that add interactivity to websites eventually end up as JavaScript(CoffeeScript for example).</p>
        <p>Like CSS, JavaScript tends to live in its own file to allow reusability and help improve maintainablity. While getting started with HTML and CSS immediately rewarding, JS requires a critical mass of knowledge before it can be used for mote than copy and and paste jobs. This is because JS has a lot more depth and complexity steep learning curve (for those new to software development), but once past that initial curve, you get into exciting and vast opportunities.   </p>
