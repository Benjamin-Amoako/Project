            <h1>INTRODUCTION TO CODING</h1><br>
            Everyone is talking about coding, but where do you start?
            <ul>
            <h2><li>WHAT ACTUALLY IS CODING?</li></h2>
            <h3><li>WHAT ARE THE TYPES</li></h3>
            <h3><li>WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANCE?</li></h3>
            <h3><li>WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT?</li></h3>
            <h3><li>HOW DOES IT WORK?</li></h3>
            <h3><li>AND WHY BOTHER DOING IT?</li></h3>
            </ul>
            On this page we will look at how computers work, how you write code to tell them what to do, and how to get started with key coding concepts. <br> You will find the materials for our introductory codding sessions and some exercises to try out the concepts. <br>
            This path will give you an introduction to the world of and and basic concept. <br> By the end, you will know whether Data Science, Computer Science or Web Development is right for you.
            <h4>In the next page are some solutions to the questions asked on board</h4>

        <span>Coding</span> is telling a computer what to do, in a way that, with bit of translation, it can understand. <br>
        The same way <br> <span>Computer Programming</span> is the process of writting code to facilitate specific action in a computer, application or software program, and instructs them on how to perform.
        <p>You give computers instuctions in what is known as 'code', in a similar way to how you might have a recipe for how to cook something. You tell the computer about elements it needs to work with (like the ingredients), you give it instructionsm and there might be some conditions it needs to choose between(like choosing whether an oven is electric or gas and then following the corresponding temperature).</p>
        <p>These instructions you give the computer need to be broken down int every single task, without ambiguity. It can take practice to think as a computer would so you can work out what instriction would need to be written.</p>
        <b>The Types Of Programing Languages Are</b>
        <ul>
        <li>Procedual Programing Language</li>
        <li>Funtional Programing Language</li>
        Scripting Programing Language
        <li>Logic Programming Language</li>
        <li>Object-Oriented Programing Language</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But everything in this world starts from somewhere. <br>
        In this site we will focus on the starting point. ie: <span>HTML...</span></p>
